# Troll plugin

This is the best plugin if you're hosting a public lavalink instance. It automatically cleans up resources by disconnecting clients :)

## How to use your plugin

```yml
lavalink:
  plugins:
    - dependency: com.github.lavalink:lavalink-plugin-template:{VERSION} # replace {VERSION} with the version you want to use
      repository: https://jitpack.io
```

## How to get help

If you need help, you can join the [Lavalink Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jttmwHTAad) and ask in
the `#plugin-development` channel.
